## Overview

Turbo AI Rules now exposes commands for **source management**, **asset selection**, **adapter management**, and **visual workflows**.

### Quick Access

- **Status Bar**: Click **🤖 AI Rules** icon
- **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → Type `Turbo AI Rules`
- **Tree View**: Right-click in **AI Rules** sidebar

### Current Core Workflow

1. `Add Source` - connect one or more Git-based asset repositories

3. `Manage Adapters` - enable preset/custom adapters and suites
4. `Open Sync Page` - choose assets and grouped output targets
5. `Generate Config Files` - regenerate outputs on demand

### Tree View Icon Legend

The extension uses **colored icons** to indicate rule priority:

- 🔴 **Red** - High priority (HIGH)
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Medium priority (MEDIUM)
- ⚪ **White** - Normal priority (NORMAL)
- ⚫ **Gray** - Low priority (LOW)

Markers in rule descriptions:

- **✓ 已选** - Rule is selected for config generation
- **+N** - Number of additional tags (e.g., `+3` means 3 more tags not shown)

---

## 1. 🔗 Add Source

**Command**: `Turbo AI Rules: Add Source`

**Function**: Add a new Git rule repository as a rule source

### Use Cases

- Initial extension setup
- Add team-shared rule repositories
- Add personal rule repositories
- Add quality community rule sources

### Steps

1. Execute the command (or click the + button in status bar/tree view)
2. Enter Git repository URL
   - Public repo: `https://github.com/username/repo.git`
   - Private repo: Provide access token in subsequent steps
3. Select branch (optional, defaults to `main`)
4. Specify subpath (optional, e.g., `rules` or `docs/rules`)
5. Set display name (optional, for easy identification in tree view)
6. Provide access token (required for private repos only)

### Example

```
URL:      https://github.com/company/coding-rules.git
Branch:   main
Subpath:  /best-practices
Name:     Company Rules
Token:    ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx (private repo)
```

### Tips

- 🔐 Access token only needs `repo` (full repository access) permission
- 📁 Use subpath to sync only specific directories within the repository
- 🏷️ Set clear names for managing multiple rule sources

---

## 2. 🗑️ Remove Source

**Command**: `Turbo AI Rules: Remove Source`

**Function**: Remove an added rule source

### Use Cases

- Remove rule sources that are no longer needed
- Clean up outdated rule repositories
- Remove rules no longer used by the team

### Steps

1. Execute the command
2. Select the rule source to delete from the list
3. Confirm the deletion

**Alternatively**:

- Right-click on the rule source in the tree view
- Select **Remove**

### Important Notes

- ⚠️ Deleting a rule source will remove all rules from that source in the cache
- 🔄 Config files will be automatically regenerated after deletion (excluding rules from that source)
- 💾 Local Git clone will be deleted, but doesn't affect the remote repository

---

## 3. 🔄 Sync Rules

**Command**: `Turbo AI Rules: Sync Rules`

**Function**: Sync the latest rules from all enabled rule sources

### Use Cases

- Get the latest updates from rule sources
- Sync after adding a rule source for the first time
- Manually trigger rule updates (when auto-sync hasn't triggered in time)

### Steps

1. Execute the command (or click the 🔄 button in tree view)
2. The extension will sequentially:
   - Pull the latest code from Git repositories (`git pull`)
   - Parse all rule files (`.md` format)
   - Apply conflict resolution strategy (if duplicate rules exist)
   - Automatically generate all enabled config files

### Output Log Example

```

See [02. Configuration Guide](./02-configuration.md) for details.

### Tips

- ⏱️ First sync may take a few seconds to minutes (depends on number of rules)

## 5. 📝 Generate Config Files

**Command**: `Turbo AI Rules: Generate Config Files`

**Function**: Manually regenerate all AI tool configuration files

### Use Cases

- Config files were accidentally deleted or modified
- Regenerate after changing adapter configuration
- Manually verify config file generation logic

### Steps

1. Execute the command
2. The extension will regenerate all enabled config files based on current configuration

### Generated Files

```
✅ Cursor:       .cursorrules
✅ Copilot:      .github/copilot-instructions.md
⚙️ Continue:     .continuerules (if enabled)
✅ Custom:       Generated based on custom adapter config
```

### Important Notes

- ⚠️ **Will overwrite existing config files**, manual modifications will be lost
- 💡 Recommend modifying rule sources instead of config files themselves
- 🔄 This command is automatically called when syncing rules

### Tips

- If you don't want config generation for a specific tool, disable the corresponding adapter in settings
- Custom adapters support configuring multiple output targets

- Update access token (when token expires or changes)
- Enable/disable rule sources

### Steps
